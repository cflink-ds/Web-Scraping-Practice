# Web-Scraping-Practice
This is a project that I found some pointers and parts as well as the fake website to scrape on the following website: https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/

I was interested in how to pull data from websites and learned a little bit about how the process works and how to use 'beautiful soup' to create a web scraper. This project was very basic from beginning to end, but still taught me about how the concept works. I hope to work on more web scraping in the future with more in-depth websites that may be more complicated. But for now this is as deep as this project gets. - More to come - :)
